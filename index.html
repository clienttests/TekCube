										<h3>Who we are</h3>
										<p>TekCube is a development company based in Queensland, Australia. Started in early November 2010 by close friends Phillip Kilby (Managing Director) and Daniel Battye (Chief Executive Officer), work immediately began upon our first game, then-called YanzCity with a small team consisting of Marc Lequime (UX Designer) and Calum Scott (Programmer). With the team consisting of just a programmer, an artist and the pair of founders, TekCube incorporated and became the company it is today.</p>
                                         
                                         <h3>What we do</h3>

                                         <p>While TekCube is but a small, but growing company - it consists of just 4 employees - we aspire to become one of the most influential and brilliant developers out there. Our offices are our homes. Our workplaces are our studies. But what we have got, that we think is really unique, is a vibrant passion for the work that we do, and a powerful desire to achieve our objectives. Clear goals, good design and straightforward implementation are key elements of our development here at TekCube, and we're constantly looking for newcomers to join the unit.</p>

                                         <h3>What we want to start doing.</h3>

                                         <p>But we have so much more aspiration than just a game. We at TekCube are looking to expand into a wide range of projects, over many different types of services. And as we grow, you will see new projects appear on these very pages as we expand from a small four-person team to a large-scale company. </p>
